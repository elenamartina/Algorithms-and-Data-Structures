# Algorithms and Data Structures repository

This repository contains some of my work done for the Algorithms and Data Structures module at Uni. Each folder contains their respective Algorithm/Data Structure and some Junit tests.

To run each test, move into each folder:
```
$ cd HuffmanEncoder
```
...and just run:
```
$ make test
```
